<p>
  Overeyes details are noted here, update logs are included here and as well as the status of the game.
  The 4 statuses are as follows: In development, Finished, Published, and Discontinued. It's rare we discontinue any of our games but can still happen.

  <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
    <li>Status: Finished</li>
    <li>Updates: 0</li>
    <li>Release Date: Not Avaliable</li>
    <li>Developers: Duck and Deleted User.</li>
    <li>Notes: Not published yet, will publish to steam</li>
  </ul>

  Information to know: The game features 8 characters, and 7 bosses, one difficult. The game will be a run and gun game with multiplayer, and later an anti cheat, (Looking at you, reverse engineers) and a story mode. The game should have about more than 20 bosses, no accurate number yet.
