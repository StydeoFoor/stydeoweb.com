<p>
  Retro Hole will make the second game in the Stydeo Librery! The game is a retro game set in the 1980s in the universe of unreleased games. A previous star of the show returns as he is trapped in a new dimension, Mason, from Overeyes, he embarks on a quest to find his way out. He uses his knowledge thats given to natural born teacher-correctors, and some of his sarcasm, to look for some sort of way to hack through the system and escape successfully, tis' but a interruption.
