<p>
  Retro Hole details are noted here, update logs are included here and as well as the status of the game.
  The 4 statuses are as follows: In development, Finished, Published, and Discontinued. It's rare we discontinue any of our games but can still happen.

  <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
    <li>Status: In development</li>
    <li>Updates: 0</li>
    <li>Release Date: Not Avaliable</li>
    <li>Developers: Deleted User.</li>
    <li>Notes: Will start when "A Game With No Name" is finished</li>
  </ul>

  Information to know: The game is a retro style game set in the 1980s, (and yes, it actually feels like you are playing on whatever millenials played on in the 80s) the game is a platformer with a bully, (and yes, has the 1980s personality too, so feel free into insulting him as if he can hear you) a previous star from Overeyes is included in the series as you go through wherever you feel, doing whatever is necessary to go back home.
